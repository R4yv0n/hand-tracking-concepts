# hand-tracking-concepts
Hello,
for my bachelor thesis I created a few concepts for hand tracking on the Oculus Quest. The main purpose of this prototype is to evaluate how well certain concepts work on the oculus quest and if they can be viable despite the technical limits of the hand tracking on the Quest.

The download can be found on:<br/>

If you tested the prototype it would be nice if you could spare a few minute for a survey:
